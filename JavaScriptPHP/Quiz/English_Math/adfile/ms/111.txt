A train starts from Delhi at 6:00 am and reaches Ambala cantt. at 10am. The other train starts from Ambala cantt. at 8am and reached Delhi at 11:30 am, If the distance between Delhi and Ambala cantt is 200 km, then at what time did the two trains meet each other?













Average speed of train leaving Delhi = 200/4 = 50 km/hr
Average speed of train leaving Ambala cantt. = 200 × 2/7 = 400/7
By the time the other train starts from Ambala cantt, the first train had travelled 100 km
Therefore, the trains meet after:
= (200−100)/(50+400/7) = 14/15hr
= 14/15 × 60 = 56 minutes
Hence they meet at 8:56 am
