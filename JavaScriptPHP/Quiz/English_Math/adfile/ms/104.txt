A train covers a distance in 50 min, if it runs at a speed of 48 kmph on an average. The speed at which the train must run to reduce the time of journey to 40 min will be.













Time = 50/60=5/6 hr
Speed = 48 mph
Distance  = S×T=48×(5/6) = 40 km

Time = 40/60 hr

New speed = 40×3/2 = 60 kmph
