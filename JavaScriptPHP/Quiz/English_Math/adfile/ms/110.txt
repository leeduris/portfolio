The jogging track in a sports complex is 726 m in circumference. Suresh and his wife start from the same point and walk in opposite direction at 4.5 km/hr and 3.75 km/hr respectively. They will meet for the first time in:













Let both of them meet after T min
4500 m are covered by Suresh in 60 m.
In T min he will cover 4500*T/60
Likewise, In T min Suresh's wife will cover 3750*T/60
Given,
4500*T/60 + 3750*T/60 = 726
T = 5.28 minutes
