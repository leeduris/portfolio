<h1>Express an opinion</h1>
When making an inportant decision, some people like to take a few hours or days to think before making the decision. Other people like to make decisions very quickly. Which do you prefer and why?













<h3>taking a few house.....</h3>
the more important the decision is, the more time I usually spend and need
can be guided by a consideration of various pros and cons
require lots of discussion with other people, comparing what they say with what
I think usually makes me clearly see what are the priorities and what are less
important thing that I don't have to pay much attention to.

<h3>quickly.....</h3>
sometimes, takes too much time to decide and never put it into the action
better to make a quick decision and learn from the result and make another decision again
