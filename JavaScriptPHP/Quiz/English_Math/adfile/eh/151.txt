There is a plan to hold the Olympics near your town/city. Are you in favor of this idea?













I'm a big sports fan.
It would be good for local businesses.
Having the Olympics would make my town famous all over the world.
There will be a lot of nouse and traffic jams.
It will cost too much money to hold the games and we should pay more taxas.
I want my town to be peaceful and relaxing.
