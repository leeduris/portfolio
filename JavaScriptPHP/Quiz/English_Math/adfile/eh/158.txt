Do you prefer or travel by public transportation or to travel by your own car?













<h3>public transportation.....</h3>
can be more convenient, quicker, and cheaper.
causes less pollution, and so it is better for the environment

<h3>your own car.....</h3>
public transportation can be stressful in the rush hour.
normally more reliable, because you can leave when you want to and you don't have to wait.
