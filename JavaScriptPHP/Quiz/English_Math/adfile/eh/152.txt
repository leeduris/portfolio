Some people believe private cars should be banned from downtown areas. What do you think?













If there were fewer cars there would be less air pollution.
There would not be any traffic jams downtown.
The city would be a nicer place because it would be less noisy.
There must be reasons why people need to drive their cars in downtown.
People should decide whether they drive or take public transportation.
The government can't force them not to drive their own cars.
