<h1>Express an opinion</h1>
Living in a large, old city can be a nightmare for driving a car. Crowded streets, lack of parking, and traffic jams can all frustrate drivers. Do you think public transportation such as buses, and subway are developed enough to make big city living easy or do you find it better to drive your car? Give reasons for your opinion.













<h3>public transportation.....</h3>
better for the environment, faster, and more affordable.
can go anywhere using the public transportation system in my city
gasoline prices, car maintenance, toll-gate fees and terrible traffic

<h3>driving a car.....</h3>
In the public transportation system, employees are constantly going on strike, buses are never on time and are driven recklessly.
impossible to find a bus or subway that goes from A to B without two or three transfers and wasted time
