<h1>Describe a Picture</h1>














This is a picture of people riding in a horse-drawn wagon.
There is a man in the middle is wearing a nice cowboy hat and holding leasher.
He is driving two big brown horses in front of him. On the wagon,
I can see many people who look like tourist sitting and smiling.
It looks like they are going to a farm or looking around this pasture.
It must be a little bit cold beacause people are wearing jackets and the trees and grass are grey.
