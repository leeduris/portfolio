Is it better to enjoy your money when you earn it, or is it better to save your money for some time in the future?













<h3>save your money.....</h3>
be able to live comfortable lives when I retire
people live longer, so they can enjoy money later in life

<h3>enjoy it.....</h3>
use my money to buy something that I like
treating my self well encourages me to work more and better
