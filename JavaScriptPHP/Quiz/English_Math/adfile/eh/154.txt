Would you rather play an individual sport or a team sport?













Joining a sports team is a good way to make friends.
I would be able to learn new skills.
It is usually more interesting to play together.
I can play whenever I want to, without asking people to play with me.
I need some time alone to think about my self, away from people or jobs.
I can focus on how or what I'm playing, for example, I can watch out my self while I'm working aut at the gym.
