<h1>Express an opinion</h1>
Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? It is better to make the wrong decision than to make no decision at all.













<h3>wrong decision.....</h3>
at least you are trying something not wasting time to wait
Even though you end up to fail, you learn something from the mistakes

<h3>no decision.....</h3>
sometimes, time can solve problems
wait and see is not always bad you can have more time to think.
listening to others is better than making a quick decision when you are not sure
