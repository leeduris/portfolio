Do you prefer to eat out or do you like to cook at home? Which do you think is better and why?













<h3>enjoy eating out.....</h3>
very convenient, quick and easy choice
a great selection of foods to choose
this saves us time and the trouble of cooking and doing dishes later

<h3>cook at home.....</h3>
can always make something I like and can be sure that it will taste good
so hard to find a good restaurant, don't have to drive across the city
impossible to afford every night
