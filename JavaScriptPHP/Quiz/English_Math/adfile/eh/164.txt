Around the world today, many parents spend a great deal of money to educate their children overseas. Unfortunately, the same students can have returning back into classrooms and the school system when they come back to their native country. Should students receive an education in their home country or should they go overseas to study? Which do you think it better and why?













<h3>going to live and study overseas.....</h3>
let our children have many chances to see different culture
the exeperience and education will make up for the expense in the long run

<h3>not a good idea to educate children overseas.....</h3>
Children are fragile and need stability in their lives to develop with their friends and family nearby
they can travel the world and go places during their summer and winter vacations and gain many new experiences
it is better that they spend only a small period of time visiting another country
