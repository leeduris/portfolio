<h1>Describe a Picture</h1>














Intro:
This is a picture of a music concert.

Main Focus:
In the middle of the picture, there is a man wearing a black suit and playing the piano.
Also, I can see lots of musicians playing various musical instruments, such as violins and cellos.
In front of them, a man is conducting the orchestra. He must be a conductor.

Sub Focus:
Beautiful red flowers are arranged around the stage.
Behind the flower decorations, a large audience is sitting in rows and listening to music.

Closing:
I guess the musicians must be playing classical music.
