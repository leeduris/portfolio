<h1>Describe a Picture</h1>














Intro:
This is an outdoor market.

Main Focus:
In the middle of the picture, there are many vegetables displayed on the stand, such as tomatoes and cucumbers.
Behind the stand, I can see a vendor with her hair in pig tails, and she is holding a plastic bag.
Opposite her, a customer wearing a blue shirt seems to be taking some money out of her wallet.

Sub Focus:
Next to her, there is another customer wearing sunglasses, and she is holding something like a zucchini.
It looks like she is trying to find good qualty items.
At the top of the picture, I can see big canopies open over the stands.

Closing:
It looks like this is a popular market since it is crowded with many customers.
