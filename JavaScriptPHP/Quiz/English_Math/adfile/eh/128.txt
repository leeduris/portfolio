Intro:
This is a picture of a science class.

Many young students are sitting on the floor and looking at the teacher.
One of them in the middle is gesturing with his hands.
On the left side of the picture, the teacher behind the table is wearing a grey apron with a name tag on it.

Sub Focus:
There is a lot of equipment on the table to conduct experiments.
Also, there is a picture posted on the board behind the teacher.
In the background of the picture, I can see something written on the blackboard.
