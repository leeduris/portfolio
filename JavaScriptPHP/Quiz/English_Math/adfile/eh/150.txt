<h1>Express an opinion</h1>
Some people trust their first impression about a person's character because they belive these judgments are generally correct. Other people do not judge a person's character quickly because they believe first impressions are often wrong. Which attitude do you agree with?












<h3>First impression.....</h3>
Sometimes, first impression is enough to tell who you are and what you are.
It can be more than 50% correct.
People's judgement is made from their experience and instincts.

<h3>Not first impression.....</h3>
Generally, it's dangerous to belive your first impression and judge people by it.
People can be totally different from how they look.
It takes time to judge people if someone is good or bad.
