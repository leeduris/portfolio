<h1>Express an opinion</h1>
Would you prefer to work in a large group, or with just a few people? Explain why?













<h3>a large group....</h3>
- learn more from people // not boring // competition makes me work better

<h3>a few people....</h3>
- cooperation is stronger than in a large group, can be closer to co-workes
- my role (job) will be bigger, take a better role, more parts for the project.
