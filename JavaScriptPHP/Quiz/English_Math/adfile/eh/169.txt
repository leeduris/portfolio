If you have to hire a new employee, would you hire an experienced worker with higher salary, or would you hire an inexperienced worker with lower salary?













<h3>experienced worker with hogh pay.....</h3>
one experienced workers work more efficiently than several inexperienced workers
they make least damage and loss on the business because they know how to deal with problems from their experience.

<h3>inexperienced workers with lower pay.....</h3>
some work doesn't need high quality skills or experience, it needs just labor or time.
some experienced workers are too expensive so the company needs more budget, but their work is not worth the high pay
