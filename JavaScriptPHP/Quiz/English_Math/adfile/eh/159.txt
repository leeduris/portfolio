Many people think that school children should be required to wear a uniform in school, instead of clothes they choose themselves.
Others believe that children should not have to wear a uniform. Which do you think is better and why?












<h3>uniform.....</h3>
uniforms shows the identification of children, they behave like students, not adult.
does not show their wealth, doesn't create discrimination between rich and poor
don't have to take much time to what clothes should I wear to school or how to look.

<h3>private clothes.....</h3>
it's very important for children to feel happy in the school environment
they are unique, they have the right to wear what they want and to express
their individuality thanks to their clothes.
