Some restaurants are famous for having good food but a poor atmosphere. Other restaurants have wonderful atmosphere but poor quality food. Which do you think is better and why?













<h3>choose poor atmosphere and good food.....</h3>
After eating poor food, it is hard to enjoy going out to the same restaurant again.
Even if a restaurant is loud, dirty, and in a bad location, it is OK if the food is good.
it is better that the cook is too busy to take care of the restaurant's atmosphere, but takes care of the restaurant's food.

<h3>good atmosphere and poot food.....</h3>
the atmosphere is very important when I have meals for business.
Even if the food is just average, I can still impress my clients with good service, nice people and a fantastic atmosphere.
