<h1>Describe a Picture</h1>














This is a picture of 4 people sitting on a bench.
All of them look pretty old and two of them on the left end of the bench are dozing off with their heads backward.
The other two people look like a couple because they holding their hands and putting them on the man's legs.
And the lady is wearing a red winter jacket and a white scarf and has a black leather bag on her legs. The bench is in front of the nice stone wall.
It seems like they are waiting for a bus or something because the couple is looking at the right side of the picture together.
