Some people prefer to go to concerts. Others prefer listening music at home. Which do you prefer? Why?













<h3>concert.....</h3>
more active and exciting // watch your favorite performers in perrson best experience in your life

<h3>listening at home.....</h3>
feel comfortable at home (get stressed from people at the concert)
concerts are very so expensive that I'd rather buy more CDs with that much money
