<label class = 'title'>Row sorting</label>
Implement the following method to sort the rows in a two dimensional array. A new array is returned and the original array is intact.

public static double[][] sortRows(double[][] m)

Write a test program that prompts the user to enter a 3 * 3 matrix of double values and displays a new row-sorted matrix. Here is a sample run:

Enter a 3-by-3 matrix row by row:
0.15 0.875 0.375
0.55 0.005 0.225
0.30 0.12 0.4
The row-sorted array is
0.15 0.375 0.875
0.005 0.225 0.55
0.12 0.30 0.4
