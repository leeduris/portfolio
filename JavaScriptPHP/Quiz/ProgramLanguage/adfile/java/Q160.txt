<label class = 'title'>Financial application: loan amortization schedule</label>
The monthly payment for a given loan pays the principal and the interest. 
The monthly interest is computed by multiplying the monthly interest rate and 
the balance (the remaining principal). The principal paid for the month is 
therefore the monthly payment minus the monthly interest. Write a program that 
lets the user enter the loan amount, number of years, and interest rate and 
displays the amortization schedule for the loan. 

Here is a sample run:
