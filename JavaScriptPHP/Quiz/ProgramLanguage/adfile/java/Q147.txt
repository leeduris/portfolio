<label class = 'title'>Financial application: monetary units</label>
Suppose you want to develop a program that changes a given amount of 
money into smaller monetary units. The program lets the user enter an 
amount as a double value representing a total in dollars and cents, 
and outputs a report listing the monetary equivalent in the maximum 
number of dollars, quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies, in this 
order, to result in the minimum number of coins. 

But, to fix the possible loss of accuracy when converting a float 
value to an int value, Read the input as a string such as "11.56". 
Your program should extract the dollar amount before the decimal 
point and the cents after the decimal amount using the indexOf and 
substring methods.
