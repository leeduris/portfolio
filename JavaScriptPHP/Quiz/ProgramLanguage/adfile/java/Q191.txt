Using Zeller’s algorithm to get the start day of the month,
display the year and the month in the stub.

Zeller’s congruence is an algorithm developed by Christian
Zeller to calculate the day of the week. The formula is

h = [day + 26*(month+1)/10 + (year%100) + (year%100)/4 +
    (year/100)/4 + 5*(year/100)] % 7;

where h is the day of the week (0: Saturday, 1: Sunday, 2: Monday,
           3: Tuesday, 4: Wednesday, 5: Thursday, 6: Friday).
      q is the day of the month.
      m is the month (3: March, 4: April, …, 12: December). January
           and February are counted as months 13 and 14 of the previous year.
      j is the century (i.e., year/100).
      k is the year of the century (i.e., year % 100).
