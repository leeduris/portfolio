<label class = 'title'>Game: scissor, rock, paper</label>
The program randomly generates a number 0, 1, or 2 representing
scissor, rock, and paper. The program prompts the user to enter 
a number 0, 1, or 2 and displays a message indicating whether the 
user or the computer wins, loses, or draws. 
Write the program to let the user continuously play until either 
the user or the computer wins more than two times than its opponent.
