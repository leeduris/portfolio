<label class = 'title'>Algebra: quadratic equations</label>
Design a class named QuadraticEquation for a quadratic equation ax2 + bx + x = 0. The class contains:

■ Private data fields a, b, and c that represent three coefficients.
■ A constructor for the arguments for a, b, and c.
■ Three getter methods for a, b, and c.
■ A method named getDiscriminant() that returns the discriminant, which is (b^2 - 4ac).
■ The methods named getRoot1() and getRoot2() for returning two roots of the equation

r1 = [-b + √(b^2 - 4ac)] / 2a     and     r2 = [-b - √(b^2 - 4ac)] / 2a

These methods are useful only if the discriminant is nonnegative. Let these methods return 0 if the discriminant is negative. Write a test program that prompts the user to enter values for a, b, and c and displays the result based on the discriminant. If the discriminant is positive, display the two roots. If the discriminant is 0, display the one root. Otherwise, display “The equation has no roots.”
