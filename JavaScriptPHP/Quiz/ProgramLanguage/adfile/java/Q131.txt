Write a program that prompts the user to enter an integer and 
determines whether it is divisible by 5 and 6, whether it is divisible
by 5 or 6, and whether it is divisible by 5 or 6, but not both.

Here are some sample runs:
Enter an integer: 10  [enter]
Is 10 divisible by 5 and 6? false
Is 10 divisible by 5 or 6? true
Is 10 divisible by 5 or 6, but not both? true
