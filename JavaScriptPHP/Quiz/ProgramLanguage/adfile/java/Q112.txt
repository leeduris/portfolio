<label class = 'title'>Physics: finding runway length</label>
Given an airplaneâ€™s acceleration a and take-off speed v, you can compute 
the minimum runway length needed for an airplane to take off using the 
following formula: length = v2 / 2a

Write a program that prompts the user to enter v in meters/second (m/s) and the
acceleration a in meters/second squared (m/s2), and displays the minimum runway
length.

Here is a sample run:
Enter speed and acceleration: 60 3.5  [enter]
The minimum runway length for this airplane is 514.286
