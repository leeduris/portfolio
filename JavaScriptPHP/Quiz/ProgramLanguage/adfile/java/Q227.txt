<label class = 'title'>Geometry: rightmost lowest point</label>
In computational geometry, often you need to find the rightmost lowest point in a set of points. Write the following method that returns the rightmost lowest point in a set of points.

public static double[] getRightmostLowestPoint(double[][] points)

Write a test program that prompts the user to enter the coordinates of six points and displays the rightmost lowest point. Here is a sample run:

Enter 6 points: 1.5 2.5 -3 4.5 5.6 -7 6.5 -7 8 1 10 2.5
The rightmost lowest point is (6.5, -7.0)
