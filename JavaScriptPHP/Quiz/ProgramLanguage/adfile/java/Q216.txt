<label class = 'title'>Financial application: compute tax</label>
For each filing status, there are six tax rates. Each rate is applied to a certain amount of taxable income. For example, from the taxable income of $400,000 for a single filer, $8,350 is taxed at 10%, (33,950 - 8,350) at 15%, (82,250 - 33,950) at 25%, (171,550 - 82,550) at 28%, (372,550 - 82,250) at 33%, and (400,000 - 372,950) at 36%. The six rates are the same for all filing statuses, which can be represented in the following array:

double[] rates = {0.10, 0.15, 0.25, 0.28, 0.33, 0.35};

The brackets for each rate for all the filing statuses can be represented in a twodimensional array as follows:

int[][] brackets = {
{8350, 33950, 82250, 171550, 372950}, // Single filer
{16700, 67900, 137050, 20885, 372950}, // Married jointly // -or qualifying widow(er)
{8350, 33950, 68525, 104425, 186475}, // Married separately
{11950, 45500, 117450, 190200, 372950} // Head of household
};

Suppose the taxable income is $400,000 for single filers. The tax can be computed as follows:

tax = brackets[0][0] * rates[0] +
(brackets[0][1] – brackets[0][0]) * rates[1] +
(brackets[0][2] – brackets[0][1]) * rates[2] +
(brackets[0][3] – brackets[0][2]) * rates[3] +
(brackets[0][4] – brackets[0][3]) * rates[4] +
(400000 – brackets[0][4]) * rates[5]
