<label class = 'title'>Science: wind-chill temperature</label>
Write a program that prompts the user to enter a temperature and a wind speed.
The program displays the wind-chill temperature if the input is valid; otherwise,
it displays a message indicating whether the temperature and/or wind speed is
invalid.

Twc = 35.74 + 0.6215*Ta - 35.75*(V^0.16) + 0.4275*Ta*(V^0.16)
where Ta is the outside temperature measured in degrees Fahrenheit and V is the
speed measured in miles per hour. Twc is the wind-chill temperature. The formula
cannot be used for wind speeds below 2 mph or temperatures below -58ºF or
above 41ºF.
