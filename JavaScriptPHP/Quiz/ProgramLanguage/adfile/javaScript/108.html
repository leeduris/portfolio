    <h1>External scripts</h1>

    <p><kbd>External scripts are practical when the same code is used in many different web pages.</kbd></p>
    <p><kbd>JavaScript files have the file extension .js.</kbd></p>
    <p><kbd>To use an external script, put the name of the script file in the src (source) attribute of the &ltscript> tag:</kbd></p>
    <p><kbd>You can place an external script reference in &lthead> or &ltbody> as you like.</kbd></p>
    <p><kbd>The script will behave as if it was located exactly where the &ltscript> tag is located.</kbd></p>
    <p><kbd>It separates HTML and code</kbd></p>
    <p><kbd>It makes HTML and JavaScript easier to read and maintain</kbd></p>
    <p><kbd>Cached JavaScript files can speed up page loads</kbd></p>
    <p><kbd>Note: Function() is stored in an external file called "script.js".</kbd></p>
