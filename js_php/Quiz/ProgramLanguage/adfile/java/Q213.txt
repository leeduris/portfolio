<label class = 'title'>Algebra: multiply two matrices</label>
Write a method to multiply two matrices. The header of the method is:

public static double[][]
    multiplyMatrix(double[][] a, double[][] b)

To multiply matrix a by matrix b, the number of columns in a must be the same as the number of rows in b, and the two matrices must have elements of the same or compatible types. Let c be the result of the multiplication. Assume the column size of matrix a is n. Each element cij is ai1 * b1j + ai2 * b2j + c + ain * bnj.

For example, for two 3 * 3 matrices a and b, c is
(
a11 a12 a13
a21 a22 a23
a31 a32 a33
) * (
b11 b12 b13
b21 b22 b23
b31 b32 b33
) = (
c11 c12 c13
c21 c22 c23
c31 c32 c33
)
where cij = ai1 * b1j + ai2 * b2j + ai3 * b3j.

Write a test program that prompts the user to enter two 3 * 3 matrices and displays their product. Here is a sample run:
