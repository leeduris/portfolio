<label class = 'title'>Geometry: point on line segment</label>
Write a program that prompts the user to enter the three points for 
p0, p1, and p2 and displays whether p2 is on the line segment from p0 to p1.

Here are some sample runs:
Enter three points for p0, p1, and p2: 1 1 2 2 3.5 3.5  [enter]
(3.5, 3.5) is not on the line segment from (1.0, 1.0) to (2.0, 2.0)
