<label class = 'title'>Geometry: area of a hexagon</label>
The area of a hexagon can be computed using the following formula 

Area = (6 * s^2) / (4 * tan(Ï€/6))    (s is the length of a side) 

Write a program that prompts the user to enter the side of a hexagon and displays
its area.

Here are some sample runs:
Enter point 1 (latitude and longitude) in degrees: 39.55, -116.25  [enter]
Enter point 2 (latitude and longitude) in degrees: 41.5, 87.37  [enter]
The distance between the two points is 10691.79183231593 km
