<label class = 'title'>Strictly identical arrays</label>
The two-dimensional arrays m1 and m2 are strictly identical if their corresponding elements are equal. Write a method that returns true if m1 and m2 are strictly identical, using the following header:

public static boolean equals(int[][] m1, int[][] m2)

Write a test program that prompts the user to enter two 3 * 3 arrays of integers and displays whether the two are strictly identical. Here are the sample runs.

Enter list1: 51 22 25 6 1 4 24 54 6
Enter list2: 51 22 25 6 1 4 24 54 6
The two arrays are strictly identical

Enter list1: 51 25 22 6 1 4 24 54 6
Enter list2: 51 22 25 6 1 4 24 54 6
The two arrays are not strictly identical
