<label class = 'title'>Geometry: area of a triangle</label>
Write a method that returns the area of a triangle using the following header:

public static double getTriangleArea(double[][] points)

The points are stored in a 3-by-2 two-dimensional array points with points[0][0] and points[0][1] for (x1, y1). The triangle area can be computed using the formula:

s = (side1 + side2 + side3)/2;
area = âˆš[s(s - side1)(s - side2)(s - side3)]

The method returns 0 if the three points are on the same line. Write a program that prompts the user to enter three points of a triangle and displays the triangle's area. Here is a sample run of the program:

Enter x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3: 2.5 2 5 -1.0 4.0 2.0
The area of the triangle is 2.25

Enter x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3: 2 2 4.5 4.5 6 6
The three points are on the same line
