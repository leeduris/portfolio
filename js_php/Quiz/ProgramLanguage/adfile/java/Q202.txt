<label class = 'title'>Bubble sort</label>
Write a sort method that uses the bubble-sort algorithm. The bubblesort algorithm makes several passes through the array. On each pass, successive neighboring pairs are compared. If a pair is not in order, its values are swapped; otherwise, the values remain unchanged. The technique is called a bubble sort or sinking sort because the smaller values gradually “bubble” their way to the top and the larger values “sink” to the bottom. Write a test program that reads in ten double numbers, invokes the method, and displays the sorted numbers.
