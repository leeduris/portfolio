<label class = 'title'>Geometry: point position</label>
Write a program that prompts the user to enter the three points for 
p0, p1, and p2 and displays whether p2 is on the left of the line 
from p0 to p1, on the right, or on the same line.

Here are some sample runs:
Enter three points for p0, p1, and p2: 4.4 2 6.5 9.5 -5 4  [enter]
(-5.0, 4.0) is on the left side of the line from (4.4, 2.0) to (6.5, 9.5)
