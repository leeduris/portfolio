<label class = 'title'>Geometry: two rectangles</label>
Write a program that prompts the user to enter the center x-, 
y-coordinates, width, and height of two rectangles and determines
whether the second rectangle is inside the first or overlaps with the first.

Here are some sample runs:
Enter r1's center x-, y-coordinates, width, and height: 2.5 4 2.5 43  [enter]
Enter r2's center x-, y-coordinates, width, and height: 1.5 5 0.5 3   [enter]
r2 is inside r1
