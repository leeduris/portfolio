<label class = 'title'>Algebra: solve linear equations</label>
Write a method that solves the following 2 * 2 system of linear equations:

a00x + a01y = b0
a10x + a11y = b1

x = (b0a11 - b1a01) / (a00a11 - a01a10)
y = (b1a00 - b0a10) / (a00a11 - a01a10)

The method header is public static double[] linearEquation(double[][] a, double[] b)

The method returns null if a00a11 - a01a10 is 0. Write a test program that prompts the user to enter a00, a01, a10, a11, b0, and b1, and displays the result. If (a00a11 - a01a10) is 0, report that “The equation has no solution.”
