    <h1>Difference Between Undefined and Null</h1>

    <p><kbd>In JavaScript null is "nothing". It is supposed to be something that doesn't exist.</kbd></p>
    <p><kbd>In JavaScript, the data type of null is an object.</kbd></p>
    <p><kbd>In JavaScript, a variable without a value, has the value undefined. The typeof is also undefined.</kbd></p>
    <p><kbd>You can also empty an object by setting it to undefined.</kbd></p>
