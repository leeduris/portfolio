A train covers a distance in 100 min, if it runs at a speed of 48kmph on an average. The speed at which the train must run to reduce the time of journey to 40 min will be:













Time = 100/60 = 5/3hr
Speed = 48 mph
Distance = S×T
= 48×53
= 80 km
Now, as per the question, journey is to be reduced to 40 min.
So, new time,
= 40 min = 40/60 hr
= 2/3 hr
New speed,
= Distance/New Time
= 80/(2/3)
= 80 × 3/2
=120 kmph
