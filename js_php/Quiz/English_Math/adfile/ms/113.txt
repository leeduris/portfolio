A man can row 4.5 km/hr in still water and he finds that it takes him twice as long to row up as to row down the river. Find the rate of the stream.













Let the speed of the current be x km/hr
Thus upward speed = (4.5−x) km/hr
and downward speed = (4.5+x) km/hr
Let distance travelled be y, then for the same distance y,
Time Rowing Upwards=2×Time Rowing Downwards
y/(4.5−x) = 2 × [y/(4.5+x)]
⇒ x = 1.5 km/hr
Edit: Thank you Sid for pointing out the typo, upwards and downwards speeds have been corrected.
