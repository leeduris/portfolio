Sachin can cover a distance in 1hr 24 min by covering 2/3 of the distance at 4 kmph and the rest at 5 kmph. The total distance is?













Let total distance = D
Distance travelled at 4 kmph speed =
Distance travelled at 5 kmph speed =
Total time =1 hr 24 min = (60+24) min =
We know,
Time=Distance/Speed
Total time
21/15 = [(2/3)/4]*D + [(1/3)/5]*D
21/15 = (2D)/12 + D/15
84=14D
D=6 km
