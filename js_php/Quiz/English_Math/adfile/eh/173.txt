Imagine, being free to pay the way you want.
In store, around the world, online, anytime.
Welcome to your life with a new TD access card.
While you can use your new card just like your old one, to debit purchases and access your bank accounts, the Visa and the contactless symbols mean you can pay in more ways with your money.
With the security of chip technology and verified by Visa, you can safely and confidently make the debit payment directly from your TD bank accounts. Whenever and however you shop.
You can now even use your new card for online debit purchases by choosing Visa or Visa debit as your form of payment. And because it’s linked to your bank account, you’re paying with your own money, not credit.
Your new TD access card can even be used for debit purchases made internationally. Wherever Visa is accepted, with payment automatically coming out of your bank account. And now you can even flash your new TD access card to make small purchases without entering your pin.
Just flash your card and way you go!
With a new TD access card that’s accepted more places than ever before, where you use next, is up to you.
For more information about your new TD access card, visit your local TD Canada trust branch or call 1-866-222-3456 FREE
