"People should stop working at age 60". Do you agree or disagree with this statment?













Many people at the age of 60 are still capable of working.
Older people need money too. Their pension is not enough for them live comfortably.
The company loses older people's valuable experience.
When older people stop working, young people get more job opportunities with new fresh ideas and enthusiasm.
Older people have been working for a long time since they were in late 20's. So it's time to take a rest and enjoy their lives with their families.
