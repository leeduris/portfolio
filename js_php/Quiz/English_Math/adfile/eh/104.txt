<h1>Describe a Picture</h1>














The picture is taken in a kitchen. There is a family of 5.
Three of them are women in the foreground of the picture and they look like they are very busy cooking some kind of stew.
One women in the middle is stirring the food and the others are looking at her.
In a distance, I can see a father and a liitle boy of this family, doing something together.
It seems like the mother is teaching two daugthers how to cook in the house.
