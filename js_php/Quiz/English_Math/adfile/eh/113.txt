<h1>Describe a Picture</h1>














This picture is taken at an outdoor market.
I can see two men standing at the grocery stand.
One man who looks like a customer is handing some money to the vendor and holding a blue plastic bag in the other hand.
The vendor is putting a paper bag to a blue plastic bag.
There are many fruits and vegetables are displaced on the stand.
I guess this place is a nice to buy groceries, because all of the fruits and vegetables look fresh.
