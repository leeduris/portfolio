<h3>a large company.....</h3>
stable for pay and jobs // special benefits or perks
broaden human relationship ( you can get to know more people who are related to your career)

<h3>a small company.....</h3>
easy to get promoted // work in different fields
strong bond between co-workers ( get closer to co-workers)
