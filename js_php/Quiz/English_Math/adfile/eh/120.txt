<h1>Describe a Picture</h1>














This picture is taken at a trolley stop. Some people are coming out of the street car.
One man is wearing white shorts and holding something black in his right hand.
Two other people are walking in the same direction behind him.
The car is painted red at the front and has a big windshield.
I can see a number 12 sign inside the car.
Since nobady is sitting on the trolley stop bench on the right side of the picture,
it looks like this street car has just arrived and will depart soon.
