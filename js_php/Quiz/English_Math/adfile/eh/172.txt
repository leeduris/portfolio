Some people prefer to complete work before starting another work, other  people prefer to do several work at the same time. what do you think about it?













<h3>complete work one by one.....</h3>
can't not focus on the work and it's very distracting
it's not efficient at all and can make a lot of mistakes

<h3>do several work at the same time.....</h3>
working only one project is boring and takes too much time to finish all work
sometimes you can get the answer how to solve the problem from the other problems and can solve all of them eventually which is called the synergy effect.
