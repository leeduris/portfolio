<h1>Describe a Picture</h1>














This is a picture of a group of children and a women in the garden.
First, the woman who looks like a teacher is standing in the middle and wearing blue jeans and a sweater around her shoulders.
On the left side of the picture, the young girl in black pants is pointing at the other children who are sitting on the opposite side of the picture.
I think they're playing a game or something.
It seems like they are having a great time because I can see all of them in this picture are smiling.
