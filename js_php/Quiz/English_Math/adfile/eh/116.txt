<h1>Describe a Picture</h1>














This is a picture of 2 people in a kitchen.
The man on the left is wearing a dark green polo shirt and brushing something with tap water at the kitchen sink.
A woman is looking at him and leaning on the counter with a dish cloth.
There is a dish rack and some items are arranged in it.
It looks like they are a couple or very close with each other, since both of them are smiling while doing a house chore together.
