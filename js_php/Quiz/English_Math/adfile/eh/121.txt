<h1>Describe a Picture</h1>














This is a picture of some people fishing on a pier.
One man on the right is holding a fishing rod and sitting on a picnic chair with his legs crossed.
Behind him, a woman is sitting on a long bench alone and looking to the right side.
She seems to be waiting for someone.
The other three people at the edge of the pier are enjoying fishing as well.
I can see a big body of fresh water smaller than a sea.
It must be a big river or a lake.
It surely is a sunny and perfect day for fishing.
