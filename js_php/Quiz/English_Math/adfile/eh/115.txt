<h1>Describe a Picture</h1>














This is a big train in the middle of the picture and two people with big bags are getting on the train.
The train has interesting picture around the windows and big ads are on the train doors.
Two old people are walking to the train and one of them is helping the other one with a cane.
A wheel chair is left empty behind them on the platform.
Other people are leaving from the train.
Since not many people are getting on the train, I guess most of the passengers are on the train already and it must be time for this train to depart from the station.
