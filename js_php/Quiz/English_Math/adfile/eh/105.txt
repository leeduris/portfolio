<h1>Describe a Picture</h1>














In this picture, what I can see first is a man in a blue lab gown.
He's sitting at the desk and seems to be writing something on the paper.
He looks pretty old, maybe over 50 and from what he's wearing,
I guess he could be a doctor or scientist.
There are many things on the desk, such as a microscope, papers, a plastic bottle, something like that. and also two or three cabinets are over his head.
He doesn't look like he's happy in this picture. I'd rather. I'd rather say he's kind of confused.
