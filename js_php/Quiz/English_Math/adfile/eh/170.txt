Some people prefer to go fast-food restaurants. others prefer to go to sit-down restaurants. Do you like fast-food restaurants or only sit down meals? Give reasons for your choice.













<h3>fast-food restaurants.....</h3>
They are perfect for when I don't have time for a sit-dawn meal.
I can get a quick meal for a low price and lets me focus on what I was working on.
I can pick up something very quickly and take it home or to go while you are driving.

<h3>sit-down restaurant.....</h3>
You can be sure you will have good ingredients, nice service, a relaxing environment.
It is always worth taking the time to eat properly.
Fast food is terrible in quality, even though it is cheap in price.
