<h3>support.....</h3>
having an airport nearby is very convenient for going on trips.
airport is a big business and would create a lot of jobs for local people

<h3>oppose.....</h3>
one of the biggest disadvantages is the noise.
airport requires a large amount of land which is not very good for the environment, and local wildlife.
