In major cites around the world, there are often poor and homeless people begging for money at subways, bus stops, and on street corners with organized criminal gangs using poor children and women to make people feel pity for them and give money, Do you think it is a good idea to help and support homeless people? Why or why not?













<h3>to help them.....</h3>
most of them are people in need of help and it can make a difference in someone's life
it makes me feel good to know that my little donation will help them get back in control of their lives or give them another chance.

<h3>not to help them.....</h3>
criminals and gangs are often using them to make money
they intentionally use young children to get people to pity them and then the criminals keep the money for themselves would be better if you give charities to people that I know are reliable and really helping, no just to people on the street
just giving money will net solve the problem.
