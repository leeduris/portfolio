<h1>Describe a Picture</h1>














This is a picture of a family looking at something together.
In the middle of the picture, there's a couple.
The man is waring a blue jacket and glasses and the woman next to him is wearing a plaid dress and pointing at something on the paper.
Three children are around them and one of them is looking over the father's shoulder and the others are on both sides of the picture.
I guess they may be lost and are looking for the direction.
