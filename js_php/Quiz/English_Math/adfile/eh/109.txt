<h1>Describe a Picture</h1>














This is a picture of a lot of people gathered in a cafeteria.
In the middle of the picture, there's one woman sitting at the table which is covered with a white table cloth. She is holding a little baby on her legs and looking at two girls sitting across from her.
Both of them are eating some desserts.
Some flower decorations and candles are placed on the table.
It seems like that people are having some food after church service or family gathering,
because I can see many old people and young children in this picture.
