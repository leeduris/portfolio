<h1>Describe a Picture</h1>














This picture is taken at one of the outdoor cafes.
Two ladies are sitting at a white patip table and seem to be waiting for a waiter to take their orders.
Both of them are wearing sleeveless shirts and shorts and tie their hair backward.
The lady on the left has a black leather bag on the table and is folding her legs on the chair.
Most of the umbrellas are open to make some shade over the tables.
In the distance, there is a beautiful pink brick building which looks very old.
I guess these two ladies are taking a rest after walking around this quiet street.
