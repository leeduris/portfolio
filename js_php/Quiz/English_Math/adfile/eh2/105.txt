The Oak tree always thought that he was far stronger than the reeds. 


He said to himself “I stand upright in storm. I don’t bend my head in fear every time the wind blows. But these reeds are really so weak." 


That very night blew a storm and the mighty oak tree was uprooted. 


“Thank god!" sighed the reeds, “Our way is better. We bend but we don’t break."  



Once, a wolf was very hungry. It looked for food here and there. But it couldn't get any. At last it found a loaf of bread and piece of meat in the hole of a tree. 



The hungry wolf squeezed into the hole. It ate all the food. It was a woodcutter's lunch. He was on his way back to the tree to have lunch. But he saw there was no food in the hole, instead, a wolf. 



On seeing the woodcutter, the wolf tried to get out of the hole. But it couldn't. Its tummy was swollen. 



The woodcutter caught the wolf and gave it nice beatings.
